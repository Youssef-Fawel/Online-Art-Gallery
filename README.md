# ðŸŽ¨ My first Spring Boot and Thymeleaf project as part of our Full Stack course.

This project is an online art gallery where:
Admins can manage artworks, artists, and users (add, update, deactivate).
Users can browse the gallery, add artworks to the cart, update their profile, and manage their account.

A great opportunity to deepen my experience in Full Stack development by applying MVC architecture, data persistence with JPA, and frontend-backend integration using Thymeleaf.
